The attached document is an interview assignment from one of the larger tech firms in Israel.
It is slightly different the the objective I said but still a very good practice on FE.

1. Get the core functionality working!
2. Use a mocks where possible to limit api calls during development.
3. There is a LIMIT of 50 api calls per day (!) (if you run out you will need to make a new key)
4. I recommend teamwork (if you do team up let me know who is on your team up to 4 members per team)

## Getting started

### Frontend

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build app in development mode and run in watch mode

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build app in production mode

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Run the tests (using Jest)

   ```bash
   # Runs the tests and watches for changes, requires git init first
   npm run test
   ```

Review and implement according to specs provided.

OVERVIEW
write a simple, responsive, web app that shows the weather of some city. The user should be
able to search for a city and save it to favorites (locally, a server is not required).
We expect to see 2 pages in this app. (weather page and favorites page).
API
The API that youâ€™ll use for this app is AccuWeather API. Please sign up and create a new app to
get an API key.
You will use 3 endpoints: location autocomplete for the search field, get current weather and
5-day daily forecast. Please read those API docs.
NOTE: this API is limited to 50 requests per day. our recommendation is to save the responses
and use them locally during development.
GOALS

1. Show us your coding skills - We want to see your strengths, donâ€™t be afraid to go wild, add
   features and customize the design.
2. Readability - Your code should be readable and self-explanatory with minimum comments.
   Remove any unused code, console logs, and files. Use logical project structure and code
   separation.
   HOW TO SUBMIT
3. Push your code to your git repository and make it public (we recommend GitHub to use
   GitHub Pages with ease), name the repo as firstName-lastName-dateOfStart
   (John-Doe-01-12-2018).
4. Deploy the compiled app to your server or GitHub pages/Heroku/etc - MUST
   Send us the git repository link and a link to the deployed app (2 links)

   SPECS
5. Create a header with navigation icons/links/buttons for main and favorites screen.
6. The main screen (weather details) will be composed of a search field to search a locationâ€™s
   weather by city name. And below it, the current weather and a 5-day forecast of the searched
   location. A location should have an indication if itâ€™s already saved in favorites, and a button to
   add/remove from favorites (it can be the same button).
7. Display Tel Aviv weather by default.
8. Favorites screen will be composed of a list of favorite locations. Each location should have an
   ID, name, and current weather. Clicking on a favorite will navigate to the main screen showing
   the details of that location.
9. Searching should be done in English letters only
10. State management is a must!
11. Responsive design is a must! (flexbox/grid will give you extra points ðŸ˜‰).
12. Error handling is a must! (Can be done with toast, modal).

BONUSES

1. Set the default location by using the Geolocation API. you will need another API endpoint for
   this: get location key by lat/lon.
2. Add dark/light theme support (add toggle button in the header).
3. Add Celsius/Fahrenheit toggle button.
4. Add animations (with good taste).
   EXAMPLE
   Weâ€™ve created a UI mockup, so youâ€™ll have a basic idea of what we expect to see.

Good luck,
